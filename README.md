## DigInG Spring Training

This repository contains a base project for the Spring web application. It uses Spring MVC, Spring Data/Hibernate, simple-users and MySQL to be deployed in Apache Tomcat. [In the wiki](https://github.com/diging-training/spring-to-action/wiki) of this repository you can find a tutorial that walks you through how to develop a very simple library app to borrow books.

This tutorial is developed by the [Digital Innovation Group](https://diging.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University.
